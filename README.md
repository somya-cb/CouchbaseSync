- **`Properties`**: Contains application-level properties, such as settings and configurations.
- **`Resources`**: Contains image assets, fonts, and other resources for the application.
- **`Services`**: Contains services such as `CouchbaseService` for database operations and `SyncService` for synchronization.
- **`Views`**: Contains UI components and pages, such as `ProfilePage`, where employee profiles are displayed.

## Key Files

- **`App.xaml`**: The entry point for the application, where application-wide resources are defined.
- **`App.xaml.cs`**: Handles the initialization of shared services like the `CouchbaseService` and `SyncService`.
- **`AppSync.csproj`**: The project file that contains references and settings for the .NET MAUI application.
- **`AppSync.sln`**: The solution file that contains the project and solution structure.
- **`MauiProgram.cs`**: The file where services and dependencies are configured for the app.
- **`Dataset.json`**: This is the dataset you can import onto Capella.
  
## üîß Setup & Configuration

### Couchbase Capella Setup

1. **Create Cluster & Bucket:**
   - Set up a Couchbase Capella cluster
   - Create bucket: `users`
   - Create scope: `employees` 
   - Create collection: `profiles`

2. **App Services Configuration:**
   - Create an App Services endpoint
   - Create a user (test-user) for the endpoint
   - In Access & Validation, use wildcard `!` to allow all access
   - Update the sync gateway URL in `SyncService.cs` with your endpoint

3. **Network Access:**
   - Allow IP address access in Capella (blocks all by default)
   - For testing: Can allow access from everywhere
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not recommended for production** - use specific IP ranges

### App Configuration

**Login Credentials:** Use the same credentials as your App Services user
